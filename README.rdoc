= Jaws - HTML5 Javascript web game development library
{<img src="https://travis-ci.org/ippa/jaws.svg?branch=master" alt="Build Status" />}[https://travis-ci.org/ippa/jaws]

Depends on JavaScript Edition 5. Works with Chrome 9+, Firefox 3.6+, Safari 5+ & IE9.

Licensed under LGPL so you're free to use it for commercial projects.

== Highlights
* Animation(), Sprite(), SpriteSheet(), TileMap(), Assets() and other useful constructors
* Easy and robust game state system to switch between menus, play, high score lists and settings
* JSDOC Documentation & commented examples

Jaws also:
- Uses 2D canvas to draw stuff on the screen
- Does not depend on any other JavaScript library
- Suple-simple-to-use collision detection, bounding box and circles.
- Doesn't try to force a certain "JS class pattern" on you, just pure JavaScript as mother nature intended it
- Tries to make assets (images, music, json data) in webgames as easy as possible
- Often does object literals as arguments for readabillity (ie. new Sprite({image: "player.png", x: 100, y: 100})
- Builds on lessons learned from years of developing http://github.com/ippa/chingu (Ruby game lib)

== What kind of games can you make with Jaws?
Jaws is well suited for "classic" side/top scrolling games (tile based or not) where you have a number of sprite-sheet-animated sprites.
Jaws comes with basic rect-vs-rect/circle-vs-circle collision detection that works well in most cases. If you have _tons_ of sprites (for example, a bullet hell schmup) you probably want to use a physicslib like Box2D or spatial
hashing like quad trees to speed things up. Jaws use of canvas makes pixel perfect collisions and worms-style terrain relatively easy to develop. If your game is very GUI-heavy you might want to base your game on pure HTML-elements instead of canvas-sprites.

== Libs using Jaws
* {http://mcfunkypants.com/tower/} - Tower Game Starter Kit
* {http://mcfunkypants.com/ludus/}[http://mcfunkypants.com/ludus/] - Platformer Game Starter Kit
* {https://github.com/deisdestiny/Jaws-TS}[https://github.com/deisdestiny/Jaws-TS] - Jaws TypeScript Definitions

== Loading Jaws
* jaws.js - includes the whole framework in one easy-to-include file.
* jaws-min.js - same as jaws.js but minified with Googles closure compiler. This is probably what you want to include in your project.
* jaws-dynamic.js - dynamically loads all separate jaws files. Useful for debugging errors when patching jaws since you get exact file/line# of possible errors. Warning, jaws-dynamic.js loads all Jaws-files asynchronously, resulting in Jaws might not be fully loaded when the browser reaches your game.js. You can solve this by hooking into the jaws.onload callback and put your jaws.start() there.

You can also link to invidual files in your HTML:
  <script src="/jawsjs/src/core.js"></script>
  <script src="/jawsjs/src/sprite.js"></script>

NOTE: core.js is always needed but after that you can pick and choose depending on what you need.
A rule of thumb is that a file named "foo.js" will include a constructor named Foo().

NOTE #2: jaws.js and jaws-min.js does Not include files from src/extras-dir.
Examples of files that aren't included in the mainbundle are: tile_map_pathfinding.js, pixel_map.js and audio.js (jaws <audio>-wrapper).
If you want to use them, load them as usual:
  <script src="/jawsjs/src/extras/tile_map_pathfinding.js"></script>

== Contribute
Jaws accepts contributions, some simple guidelines:
- Formatting: oneFunction(), OneConstrutor() and one_variable
- 2 spaces for indentation
- Don't patch jaws.js or jaws-min.js, but rather the invidual files in the src/-directory
- Please bundle tests with non-trivial patches, see test/-dir for inspiration
- For bigger patches/feature additions, please contact me beforehand to discuss if/how it fits into Jaws and how to form the API
- Naming shouldn't consist of abbreviations, let's use "context", not "ctx"

Jaws has gotten bigger contributions from:

https://github.com/videlais - QuadTree() and other things
https://github.com/dmitrizagidulin - SpriteList() rewrite
https://github.com/gregmax17 - Viewport related stuff
https://github.com/MalphasWats - Viewport pathfinding

== Issues and bugs
If you find an issue with Jaws githubs issue-tracker is the place to go. Easiest for the developers is if you put your game online. If you don't have any hosting check out http://pages.github.com/.
Pasting your problematic code in the issue-ticket itself will usually mean a lot of hassle with supportcode and assets to actually be able to test the code in question.

== API-deprecations leading up to ver 1.0
  2013-09: Remove experimental, buggy DOM-sprite-support from Sprite and Text
  2013-08: SpriteList is no longer included in jaws(-min).js bundle, better off using arrays and jaws.draw/jaws.update
  2013-08: jaws.assets.loadAll() -  onfinish -> onload, onload -> onprogress
  2013-08: jaws.assets.load(asset, options)  - options can have properties onload and onerror
  2013-03: sprite.anchor() is now sprite.setAnchor()
  2013-03: sprite.scale() is now sprite.scaleAll()

== Example
  <html>
  <script src="jaws.js"></script>
  <body>

  <canvas width=500 height=300></canvas> 

  <script>
    function MyGameState() {
      var player;
      var robot;
    
      this.setup = function() {
        player = new jaws.Sprite({image: "player.png", x: 10, y: 200});
        robot = new jaws.Sprite({x: 200, y: 200});
        robot.animation = new jaws.Animation({sprite_sheet: "images/droid_11x15.png", frame_size: [11,15], frame_duration: 120});
      }
      this.update = function() {
        if(jaws.pressed("left"))  { player.x--; }
        if(jaws.pressed("right")) { player.x++; }
        robot.setImage( robot.animation.next() );
      }
      this.draw = function() {
        player.draw();
        robot.draw();
      }
    }
    
    window.onload = function() {
      jaws.assets.add("images/droid_11x15.png");
      jaws.assets.add("images/player.png");
      jaws.start(MyGameState);
    }
  </script>
  </body>
  </html>

== The same example with comments
  /*
  * Jaws provides powerful functions like jaws.start() to quickly get a robust gameloop running.
  * It's also possible to do it more manually, fetch your own canvas context and send it to new Sprite().
  * Nothing stops you from using jaws.assets or other jaws.helpers with your own game loop either.
  *
  * Below code shows the preferred way, letting jaws worry about most of the setup, 
  * so we can get straight to get game logic.
